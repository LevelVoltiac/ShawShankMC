1) Disrespect is unqualified and uneeded in a community. Any disrespect will be located and you will be denied from joining back into the chat.
2) Bad behaviour; It happens. But we want to keep this a fun, resourceful and entertaining community chat so that all people can pop in.
3) DDoS threats. If ANYONE finds you threatening someone with a DDoS you will be reported to internet security protocols and posted as a public warning on global forums for peoples awareness.
4) Have fun. Don't sit and read the chat, Join in and talk with them
5) If the chat is annoying you, please use /alertsoff instead of asking people to shut up etc.
